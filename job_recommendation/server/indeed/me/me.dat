Director of Mechanical Engineering. L3 Open Water Power is a rapidly-growing division of L3 Technologies Sensor Systems. We are pioneering power systems for underwater applications using our novel aluminum-water chemistry. These power systems will revolutionize the deployment and utility of underwater vehicles and sensors.We are a small company of talented and curious engineers, scientists, and technicians who are focused on bringing our power systems to market. We operate in an agile, exciting, start-up environment supported by the larger L3 organization. Our work involves full design and development, ranging from fundamental science and chemical engineering to the manufacture and assembly of complete systems. We are looking for engaging, hands-on people to join our team. We focus on finding good teammates with a strong work ethic, an ability to share knowledge, and an interest in creative problem solving.Job Summary: We are currently looking for a Director of Mechanical Engineering to join our team. Our team of talented engineers needs a mentor who can challenge and coach at a high level, drawing on design experience to help deliver solutions which have a high probability of functioning the first time around. This role is the “last line of defense” for designs and needs to be confident in either releasing or holding back a design. A healthy fear of failure instilled by the terrible feeling you get when an assembly doesn’t function as intended is a requirement. While our aluminum-water chemistry is designed to replace relatively simple batteries, our power modules are much more complex with pumps, actuators, valves, controls, and sealed channels that all need to function in harsh environments while maintaining cost targets. Our cells have proven that they are an order of magnitude better than a Li-Ion battery, but the balance of plant is equally important to delivering a reliable product. We need to ensure that the power module performance is defined and limited by the electrochemistry, not the support systems. It is your responsibility to provide the robust support systems that keeps the cell stack happy and performing as expected.Additional day-to-day activities would be managing the mechanical engineering team priorities, reviewing and releasing part designs for prototype or manufacture, helping design and execute test plans, and helping to set product direction. This individual would work closely with the rest of the OWP team to hold to schedule targets for bringing our technology to market.Responsibilities: Mentor and set design direction for the Mechanical Engineering teamReview designs for function, manufacturability, and costSupport system tests and developmentTroubleshoot and solve issues before, during, and after testsWork with the OWP team to set prototype schedule and performance targetsQualifications: Degree in Mechanical EngineeringBachelor’s level plus 5-10 years related experienceExperience with SolidWorks and standard machining practicesExperience with mechanical assemblyExperience with power systems or underwater vehicles a plusCandidate must be a US citizen or green card holderL-3 Open Water Power is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
