Revit Designer (furniture) FULL TIME. Well-respected, employee-owned company on the north side of Milwaukee has an immediate opening for an experienced Revit Designer for state-of-the-art Senior Living Facilities furniture.  This is a 2-3 month contract, and for a strong performer, could lead to permanent employment.  Enjoy a progressive, modern work culture that understands Life/Work balance and the importance of giving back to the community. Experience the satisfaction of knowing you are helping our seniors experience the care and comfort they need. Be proud to join an organization that values and nurtures its team members, from tuition reimbursement to professional development.  This relaxed, collaborative environment encourages comfy attire and includes an on-site fitness center, basketball, yoga, and massages. (And you can bring your dog!)  Responsibilities:  Draw all “soft” furniture in Revit to enable designers and architects to spec Maxwell Thomas branded furniture. The products are primarily sofas, loveseats, lounge chairs and dining chairs. The basis for the file creation will be building off of pictures, renderings and some drawings, as well as physical review of the product to determine necessary dimensions that are not available from current documentation. In some cases it will make sense to create “families” of products with various widths, and in other cases they will be individual pieces. Various attributes will also need to be loaded at the time of the file creation to enable the files to provide additional information designers may need. Project Scope:  There are approximately 140 common area pieces (sofas, loveseats, lunge chairs) with a 3rd of them being collections of the 3 pieces. There are an additional 32 different dining chairs. In addition to soft seating, there will also be 12 collections of bedroom furniture (casegoods) that consist of 6-8 pieces in each collection  There are several options that need to be incorporated either as attributes or library files to show the same base unit with different features like a nail head pattern or sewn in buttons or a different back pattern as examples.  The goal is that experience will provide smart file design decisions that equal speed, accuracy and the right amount of file flexibility. This individual will need to be self-motivated and will work very independently with work direction being provided by other Revit users and/or engineering.  Requirements:  Associate Degree in Architectural Drafting strongly preferred. 2-3+ years professional experience performing CAD design, preferably in heath care interiors and furniture. Strong Revit proficiency. No training wheels here!
