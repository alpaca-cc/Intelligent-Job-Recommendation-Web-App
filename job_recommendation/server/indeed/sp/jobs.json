Our team positions ourselves similar to a product development shop, in that we invite our business partners and customers to engage us in their digitalization transformation, where we provide them working software prototypes as part of their discovery activities. We place users at the center of our universe, leveraging DevOps tooling to facilitate feedback loops that often times are less than a day. In that spirit, it’s essential that you be both well rounded and willing to learn new technologies in a short amount of time to support the goals of the work. Sound Awesome? It is.
