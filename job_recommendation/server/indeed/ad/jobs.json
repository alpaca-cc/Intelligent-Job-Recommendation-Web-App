You're about to read one of the strangest job posts of your life, and although you're a recent college grad (so not that told), I guarantee it is going to be one for the books - even in years to come.So here is the deal: I am the principal at an advertising agency (well, I own it). We also have a sales center and small business consulting firm. Really, we play Shark Tank all week. Is it fun? Some days. Mostly, the part that gets frustrating is seeing people who have no idea what they're doing and, although they may have learned some stuff in the classroom, have no idea what to do next. Really, I'm back to being a college professor, working with \"students\" all day.And, although our office has only newly opened in the Fort Lauderdale area, we're already established - but suffering some serious growing pains. I have a full team of people who are just not thinking through what they need to do next. They're trying to \"follow a process\" (that may or may not exist), rather than actually thinking through solutions.Where do you fit in? I'm looking for someone who is eager to learn. Fast. I need smart, smart people. I'll train you to do anything you want to do (from business management to digital marketing), but be smart, loyal, and willing to work ... hard. There is a lot to do here and I am really willing to give someone a chance to advance their learning like a rocket ship - without having to \"do your time\" at the big agencies of the world (where you'll be stuck in the mail room).You paid a lot for your education, so use it, while actually getting real world experience.Seriously ... be smart. Like, really smart.Know excel. Know metrics and numbers. Know sales. Know how to write. Know how to stick to a timeline and ask really good questions.Drop me a line and let me know why this appeals to you. If it doesn't, please don't apply.

Since then, assets have grown to more than $32.5 million.
