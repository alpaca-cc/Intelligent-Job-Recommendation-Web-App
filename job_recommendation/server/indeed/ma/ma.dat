Mud Bay began in 1988 when Elsa Wulff bought a struggling farm store located on a hill above Mud Bay, the southernmost reach of Puget Sound, just outside of Olympia, Washington. Joined soon after by her son and daughter, the Wulffs and their coworkers evolved Mud Bay into one of the pioneer retailers of natural foods for cats and dogs. More than twenty-five years later, Mud Bay is an employee-owned company of 40 stores and nearly 400 staff with an annual growth rate of 15% to 20%. But for all our growth, neither our mission nor our values have changed. We’re still all about contributing to the health of dogs and cats and the happiness of their owners. We’re still about empowering dog and cat owners with natural products and accurate information. And we still all about building a strong company that we can all be proud of.  Who are we?  Muddies are a passionate bunch! We’re passionate about cat and dog health. We’re passionate about delighting the people who visit our stores. We’re passionate about investing in one another. We’re a company of owners—almost every Mud Bay staffer will become eligible for a long-term stake in Mud Bay within two years of joining us. But Muddies thought and acted like owners years before we launched our Employee Stock Ownership Plan in 2015. Muddies are down-to-earth, casual and from-the heart. We work hard, and we can be intense about doing our best. There are nearly four hundred of us in two states, forty stores, a home office and distribution center, but we share a common culture—a shared culture that’s abundantly evident on the day we close all of our workplaces to bring everymuddy together in the same place at the same time for an annual event we call Mudstock.  Why join us?  Join us because you love animals. Join us because you love helping humans. Join us because you want to work with people who care as much as you do about doing a good job. Join us because you want to be an owner of the place you work—and go to work surrounded by other owner-operators. Join us because you want to help lead a company that strives to help its employees build sustaining, fulfilling, life-time careers and afford retirement when the time comes. Join us because we’ve been growing steadily and strongly for thirty years and because we’re committed to continuing to grow—but growing only as fast as we can grow well. Join us because we’re financially responsible—and because it matters even more to us to be morally responsible. Join us because you want to spend the rest of your career with a company you love.
