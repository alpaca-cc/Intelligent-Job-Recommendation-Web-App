We are revolutionizing fundamental research in the fields of single cell, immunology, and long-range genome analysis.  While DNA sequencing technology has advanced rapidly, it’s still at a level equivalent to what assembly language was to computing, with huge advances yet to be made. 10x Genomics is creating products that are doing for sequencing what C did for computing, bringing a leap in higher-order clarity, resolution, and meaning to what is now very low-level information. Software is a key part of that leap. The scale and complexity of analyzing, managing, and visualizing sequencing data means this is an area with no shortage of hard problems, where brilliant engineering still matters and yields big payoffs.  10x is dedicated to significantly raising the bar for the quality and simplicity of software experience in this field. Whether it be command-line options, logging outputs, interactive clustering visualizations, or documentation, these are all critical parts of the human interface of our software. And it is this interface through which our products ultimately communicate biological insights to our customers.  We want highly technical, highly literate individuals who excel at understanding human factors and communicating effectively. The person in this role will creatively help optimize the software experience through audio, visuals, and spoken and written word. If you are the kind of person who is an avid fan of technology in all fields, not just your own, and want to apply your talent alongside a diverse team of experts every day, join us at 10x Genomics.  Responsibilities   Work with Software, Computational Biology, Applications, Support, and Marketing to  understand our products and how to effectively communicate about them to customers.  Plan, develop, and deliver consistent, high-quality technical documentation, release notes,  tutorials, and troubleshooting guides in written and/or video formats.  Work from highly technical draft material provided by scientists and engineers, and edit and  improve them for customer consumption.  Contribute to planning, selection, and implementation of technical infrastructure for delivering  technical documentation resources.  Desired Skills and Background  Bachelors or equivalent in English, Comm., Comp. Sci., Bioinformatics or other related degree. 3+ years as a technical writer in software or related field.

Research Physical Scientist, Research AST, Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics. Duties Summary The Atmospheric Science Branch at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center (ARC) is currently seeking interested applicants for the position of a Research Physical Scientist. This position serves as a researcher in climate science. Research activities include analysis, interpretation, modeling, and application of data obtained from space, complimented by airborne, ground based, and laboratory measurements.   To receive consideration, you must submit a resume and answer NASA-specific questions. The NASA questions appear after you submit your resume and are transferred to the NASA web site. If you successfully apply, USAJOBS will show your application status as 'Received'. If your status is 'Application Status Not Available', you have not successfully applied. Do not rely on a USAJOBS email to confirm successful application. Only an email from NASA confirms a successful application.   As identical vacancies are identified, additional selections maybe made.   This position will be filled at the GS-12 grade level only; the full performance level of the position is at the GS-14 grade level. Selectee can be promoted without further competition.  Responsibilities The Physical Scientist will conduct basic research on atmospheric dynamics and processes, including the dynamical and microphysical mechanisms governing cirrus clouds in the upper troposphere, the impact of convection on the composition, humidity and cloudiness of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere and the dynamical coupling mechanisms between the stratosphere and troposphere. This position includes theoretical and modeling support of field experiments for synthesizing the observational data in the framework of atmospheric dynamics, circulation, and meteorology.   This position includes basic research on atmospheric aerosols, clouds and trace gases, including accuracy assessment of space based aerosol extinction, development of space based direct aerosol radiative effects and the development of space based aerosol typing.   With guidance from senior scientists the Physical Scientist will develop the data analysis and modeling tools required to understand the current primary research areas. The research involves developing complex numerical modeling techniques and innovative approaches to analyze data related to the structure, composition and transport processes important in the stratosphere and troposphere.   The Physical Scientist within a team performs the interpretation of observational data obtained from airborne and ground based experiments and satellite in collaboration with experimentalists and theorist. This entails being responsible for obtaining and analyzing data to apply models to problems in atmospheric science and for innovation in furthering this field of research.
